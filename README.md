The ML engine uses ensemble methods of Linear Regression, Random Forest, and SVM to provide optimal prediction. Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering was carried out using Pandas. The ML algorithms were implemented using SciKit. The API was deployed to AWS EC2 Apache server that can be accessed and embedded by any Web Service. For demonstration, Flask framework was used with regards to building a simple website that implemented the API service. The website contents was created using HTML and CSS.
